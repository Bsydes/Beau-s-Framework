**Parsed:** 2026-01-06
**Source:** Flight Plan - Guide's Guide: Operations Manual (59 pages)
**Target:** Drone/Aviation Masters Workshop (Grades 3-8)
**Duration:** 14 days
**Document Type:** Comprehensive K-8 STEM curriculum with differentiated pathways

---

## Quick Overview

A complete K-8 drone/aviation curriculum with three differentiation levels (L1: grades 3-4, L2: grades 5-6, L3: grades 7-8). Students progress through 14 days of activities building from basic flight principles to mission planning and FAA compliance. The workshop culminates in a T2P (Test-to-Pass) Defense where students demonstrate mastery of their level.

## Test-to-Pass (T2P) Criteria Summary

| Level | Requirement | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **L1** | Master 3 core flight principles + complete 1 beginner mission + explain basic drone safety | Foundations |
| **L2** | Demonstrate 5 flight mechanics + plan 2 intermediate missions + FAA awareness test | Mechanics |
| **L3** | Execute advanced mission planning + FAA Part 107 knowledge + design custom mission with risk assessment | Mastery |

## Flagged Ambiguities (12 Issues)

1. **Day 5-6 difficulty jump unclear** - Obstacle course progression between L1/L2 not quantified
2. **SMART Goal evaluation rubric missing** - No explicit scoring criteria provided
3. **Mission 0 template text not included** - Reference exists but full template absent
4. **Controller calibration steps vague** - Hardware-specific; unclear which drone model assumed
5. **Data collection methods undefined** - L2/L3 differ but exact protocols not specified
6. **Photogrammetry assessment criteria absent** - How is image quality/accuracy measured?
7. **Risk mitigation acceptance thresholds unclear** - What makes a mitigation plan "adequate"?
8. **T2P Defense panel composition undefined** - How many judges? What backgrounds?
9. **Flight hours requirement ambiguous** - "10+ flights" = how many minutes per flight?
10. **Airspace classification practice tools not listed** - Which mapping tool expected for Day 11?
11. **FAA Part 107 study materials not referenced** - Are external resources required?
12. **Day 14 scoring breakdown missing** - How are written + practical + presentation weighted?

*These ambiguities require clarification before live delivery. See full Explorer output for detailed context on each flag.*
