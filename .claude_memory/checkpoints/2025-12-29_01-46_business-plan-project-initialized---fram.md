# Checkpoint: Business plan project initialized - framework extraction strategy defined

**Created:** 2025-12-29 01:46:53

## Context

Business plan project initialized - framework extraction strategy defined

## Session Details

- **Working Directory:** /Users/bsydes
- **User:** bsydes

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Create a business plan for acquiring a CRE (Commercial Real Estate) short-term rental resort property

**Challenge:** Need to replicate the exact framework, breakdown, and layout of a 53-page exemplary business plan while minimizing token usage

**Source Materials:**
- Example business plan (53 pages) - framework to replicate
- Target property documentation
- Company acquisition materials

## Strategy Defined

### Three-Agent Workflow

1. **@explorer** - Extract framework without reading full content
   - Map document structure (TOC, sections, subsections)
   - Read specific sections page-by-page when needed
   - Saves ~90% tokens vs. uploading entire document

2. **@researcher** - Validate industry standards and data
   - CRE short-term rental best practices
   - Market analysis requirements
   - Financial projection benchmarks

3. **@historian** - Checkpoint progress after each section
   - Track completed sections
   - Never lose place in multi-session work
   - Build searchable project history

### Execution Plan

**Phase 1: Framework Extraction (One-Time)**
```
@explorer read example_business_plan.pdf
Extract: TOC, section titles, subsections, data requirements
Output: framework.md
```

**Phase 2: Section-by-Section Production**
For each of 8 main sections:
1. @explorer read specific pages (5-7 pages at a time)
2. Extract required data points
3. Draft section using target property data
4. @historian checkpoint completion
5. Move to next section

**Phase 3: Assembly & Review**
- Compile all sections
- Cross-check against framework
- Final validation

## Expected Sections (Framework TBD)

Based on typical business plans:
1. Executive Summary
2. Company Description
3. Market Analysis
4. Organization & Management
5. Services/Product Line
6. Marketing Strategy
7. Financial Projections
8. Appendices

## Token Efficiency

- Traditional approach: ~150k tokens/session (upload 53 pages repeatedly)
- Agent approach: ~5k tokens/session (section-by-section)
- **Savings: 30x reduction**

## Next Steps

1. User to provide location of example business plan file
2. Set up project directory structure
3. Run @explorer to extract framework
4. Begin Section 1 (Executive Summary)

## Project Structure (Proposed)

```
~/business-plan-project/
├── example/
│   └── old_business_plan.pdf
├── target-property/
│   ├── property_details.pdf
│   └── financials.xlsx
├── acquisition-docs/
│   └── company_info.pdf
├── output/
│   ├── framework.md (master template)
│   ├── 01-executive-summary.md
│   ├── 02-company-description.md
│   └── [sections as completed]
└── progress.md (checklist tracker)
```

## Key Principles

1. **Ultra-explicit replication** - Follow example framework exactly
2. **Incremental progress** - One section at a time
3. **Frequent checkpoints** - Never lose work
4. **Token conservation** - Read only what's needed, when needed
