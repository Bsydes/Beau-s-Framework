## 1. COMPONENT FUNCTIONALITY TESTS

### Test 1.1: EXPLORER Pattern 🔍
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- Map 2-level directory structure
- Identify entry points (main.py, index.js)
- Trace primary data flows
- Output structured findings

**Findings:**

✅ **PASS:**
- Clear trigger phrase: "Explore [target]"
- Well-defined output format with emoji markers
- Reasonable depth limit (2 levels max initially)
- Documents unknowns for follow-up

❌ **BUGS FOUND:**
1. **BUG-001**: If entry point files don't exist, no fallback behavior defined
2. **BUG-002**: No handling for permission-denied scenarios
3. **BUG-003**: No file size limits before attempting to read

⚠️ **ISSUES:**
- REDUNDANCY: "2 levels max initially" mentioned but no escalation protocol defined
- MISSING: Concrete methodology for "Trace primary data flows"
- AMBIGUITY: What qualifies as a "primary" flow?

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Add "lazy exploration" - only expand directories when relevant (saves tokens on large projects)
2. Define fallback: scan for `if __name__ == "__main__"` or `export default` if standard entry points missing
3. Add file size check: skip files >100KB, log them for manual review

---

### Test 1.2: RESEARCHER Pattern 📚
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- Define specific hypothesis
- Gather evidence from code/docs/logs
- Test assumptions with minimal code changes
- Synthesize findings with confidence percentage

**Findings:**

✅ **PASS:**
- Structured scientific approach (hypothesis → evidence → conclusion)
- Confidence percentage adds transparency
- Caveats section acknowledges limitations

❌ **BUGS FOUND:**
4. **BUG-004**: "Test assumptions with minimal code changes" has no definition of "minimal"
5. **BUG-005**: No protocol for contradictory evidence handling

⚠️ **ISSUES:**
- MISSING: No evidence weighting system (log vs code vs docs priority)
- MISSING: No time-boxing for research (could spiral indefinitely)
- UNUSED POTENTIAL: No integration with HISTORIAN for git blame analysis

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
4. Add evidence priority hierarchy: `logs > tests > code > docs`
5. Add max investigation depth: 3 levels of "why"
6. Save investigation trails to memory for pattern recognition
7. Define "minimal changes": <10 lines, no API changes, reversible in 1 command

---

### Test 1.3: THINKER Pattern 🤔
**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- State constraints
- Generate 2-3 approaches
- Evaluate against constraints
- Recommend with rationale

**Findings:**

✅ **PASS:**
- Clean decision framework
- Forces explicit constraint identification
- Limited to 2-3 options (prevents analysis paralysis)
- Requires pros/cons for each option

⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES:**
- No weighting mechanism for constraints (all treated equally)
- No stakeholder consideration matrix

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
8. Add "Quick Think" variant for simple binary decisions
9. Include reversibility score for each option (how easy to undo?)
10. Integrate with Perplexity for industry benchmark data

---

### Test 1.4: HISTORIAN Pattern 📜
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- Check git log for relevant files
- Identify key commits (behavioral changes)
- Map design evolution
- Connect past decisions to current state

**Findings:**

✅ **PASS:**
- Explicit git log integration
- Focus on behavioral changes (not cosmetic)
- Links past to present implications

❌ **BUGS FOUND:**
6. **BUG-006**: Assumes git is available - no fallback for non-git projects
7. **BUG-007**: No handling for shallow clones (limited history)
8. **BUG-008**: No timeout handling for large repos

⚠️ **ISSUES:**
- VAGUE: "Key commits" selection criteria undefined
- MISSING: No support for other VCS (SVN, Mercurial)

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
11. Add commit filtering: `--since="6 months ago"` or last N commits
12. Cache timeline in memory for repeated queries
13. Add `git blame` integration for specific line history
14. Fallback: search for "CHANGELOG" or "HISTORY" files if git unavailable

---

### Test 1.5: Pattern Selection Logic
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- Correctly route ambiguous requests to appropriate pattern(s)

**Findings:**

❌ **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND:**
9. **BUG-009 (CRITICAL)**: Pattern selection has no multi-pattern support
   - Request "understand and fix this auth bug" needs EXPLORER + RESEARCHER
   - Current logic only allows single pattern selection

10. **BUG-010 (CRITICAL)**: Decision tree branches are not mutually exclusive
    - "Clear & scoped multi-step task" matches both "Clear & scoped" AND "Complex/Multi-step"
    - No priority order defined

11. **BUG-011**: "routine_task" is undefined - what qualifies?

⚠️ **ISSUES:**
- MISSING: What if no pattern matches? (Defaults to "direct execution" - undefined)
- MISSING: Priority order when multiple patterns match equally

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
15. Add pattern chaining: `IF understanding_AND_fixing → EXPLORER then RESEARCHER`
16. Define priority order: `RESEARCHER > THINKER > EXPLORER > HISTORIAN`
17. Define "routine_task": <3 steps, no unknowns, <5 files, <1000 tokens estimated

## 2. EPHOR DELEGATION TRIGGER TESTS

### Test 2.1: Keyword Detection Logic
**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- Detect complexity trigger keywords accurately
- Activate Ephor only when appropriate

**Test Results:**

| Test Case | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| "orchestrate the deployment" | Activate | ✅ Activates | ✅ PASS |
| "coordinate between services" | Activate | ✅ Activates | ✅ PASS |
| "do this in multiple steps" | Activate | ❓ Ambiguous | ⚠️ EDGE CASE |
| "break down this complex function" | Activate | ⚠️ Edge Case | ⚠️ ISSUE |
| "full project review" | Activate | ✅ Activates | ✅ PASS |
| "analyze and implement caching" | Activate | ✅ Activates | ✅ PASS |
| "implement and analyze performance" | Activate | ❌ Fails | ❌ BUG |
| "this is a simple orchestration" | No Activate | ⚠️ False Positive | ❌ BUG |
| "don't orchestrate this" | No Activate | ❌ Activates | ❌ BUG |

❌ **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND:**
12. **BUG-012 (CRITICAL)**: Word order breaks detection
    - "analyze AND implement" works
    - "implement AND analyze" fails
    - Root cause: string matching is order-dependent

13. **BUG-013 (CRITICAL)**: No negation detection
    - "don't orchestrate" still triggers Ephor
    - "avoid multi-step" still triggers

14. **BUG-014**: No word boundary checking
    - "coordinate" matches "uncoordinated"
    - "multi-step" doesn't match "multiple steps" (natural language variant)

15. **BUG-015**: No context awareness
    - Describing orchestration triggers same as requesting it
    - "This uses orchestration internally" (false positive)

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
18. Implement proper NLP: word boundaries, lemmatization
19. Add negation detection: "don't", "avoid", "not", "without"
20. Add context signals: verb tense (describing vs requesting)

---

### Test 2.2: Token Usage Thresholds
**Status:** ❌ FAIL - UNIMPLEMENTABLE
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Expected Behavior:**
- Activate Ephor when "Token estimation > 50% of context for single response"

**Findings:**

❌ **CRITICAL DESIGN FLAW:**
The rule "Token estimation > 50% of context for single response" is:
1. **IMPOSSIBLE to calculate before execution** (circular logic)
2. **No methodology provided** for estimation
3. **Cannot know output size before producing output**

💡 **FIX REQUIRED:**
Replace impossible rule with heuristic signals:
```yaml
Token Complexity Heuristics:
  - Request mentions 5+ files → likely large output
  - Request includes "all", "every", "entire" → scope expansion
  - User history shows similar requests were >50% context
  - Request combines: analysis + implementation + testing
```

---

### Test 2.3: Ephor Workflow - 5 Phases
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Phase-by-Phase Analysis:**

#### Phase 1: Recognition & Announcement
**Status:** ✅ PASS
- Clear announcement format
- Includes complexity estimate
- States step count

#### Phase 2: Task Decomposition
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ⚠️ ISSUE: No maximum task count (could over-decompose into 100+ micro-tasks)
- ⚠️ VAGUE: "Estimate token cost per unit" - no methodology
- ⚠️ MISSING: No minimum task granularity defined

#### Phase 3: Agent Assignment
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ⚠️ VAGUE: "Success criteria" mentioned but no examples
- ⚠️ MISSING: No error handling specification per agent
- ⚠️ MISSING: Agent communication protocol undefined

#### Phase 4: Execution Orchestration
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ⚠️ UNDEFINED: "Handle failures gracefully" has no strategy
- ⚠️ MISSING: No retry logic specified
- ⚠️ MISSING: No parallel execution consideration
- ⚠️ MISSING: Circuit breaker for cascading failures

#### Phase 5: Synthesis
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- ⚠️ UNDEFINED: "Resolve any conflicts" has no resolution strategy
- ⚠️ MISSING: No rollback protocol if synthesis fails

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
21. Set max decomposition: 10 tasks (prevents over-decomposition)
22. Add failure modes: retry (3x), skip with warning, halt all
23. Define conflict resolution: last-write-wins vs manual merge vs AI mediation

---

### Test 2.4: Auto-Delegation Decision Rules
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**DELEGATE Rules Analysis:**

| Rule | Status | Issues |
|------|--------|--------|
| "Sub-task is self-contained" | ⚠️ Subjective | Needs definition: no shared state, clear I/O |
| "Clear inputs/outputs defined" | ✅ Measurable | Good rule |
| "No ambiguity in scope" | ⚠️ Subjective | How measured? |
| "Token cost is predictable" | ❌ Impossible | See BUG-015 above |

**KEEP INTEGRATED Rules Analysis:**

| Rule | Status | Issues |
|------|--------|--------|
| "Tasks are tightly coupled" | ⚠️ Vague | Needs coupling metrics (shared variables? API calls?) |
| "Context switching would lose state" | ✅ Valid | Good heuristic |
| "User prefers single-thread" | ⚠️ Undefined | How is preference captured/stored? |
| "Task is under 1000 tokens" | ⚠️ Ambiguous | Output tokens or including context? |

❌ **CONTRADICTION FOUND:**
- DELEGATE if "Token cost is predictable"
- KEEP if "under 1000 tokens"
- **Both assume token estimation capability that isn't implemented**

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATION:**
24. Replace token rules with complexity proxies: file count, dependency graph depth, API calls count

---

### Test 2.5: Token Conservation Strategies
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Strategy Evaluation:**

| Strategy | Status | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| "Checkpoint summaries" | ✅ Defined | ⚠️ No checkpoint format specified |
| "Lazy loading" | ✅ Good | ❌ Conflicts with EXPLORER (maps upfront) |
| "Output compression" | ⚠️ Vague | What compression ratio? What gets cut? |
| "Early termination" | ⚠️ Vague | No definition of "critical failure" |

**Budget Allocation (15/10/60/15):**
- ⚠️ ISSUE: Percentages are arbitrary
- ❌ BUG: No mechanism to enforce these limits
- ❌ MISSING: What happens if Analysis needs 20% instead of 15%?

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
25. Define checkpoint format: YAML with phase_id, status, outputs, next_steps
26. Resolve EXPLORER conflict: add "Deep" mode (upfront map) vs "Lazy" mode (on-demand)
27. Make budget flexible: "target" percentages with ±10% tolerance

## 3. DECISION TREE LOGIC TESTS

### Test 3.1: Task Intake Decision Tree
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Test Cases:**

| Input | Expected Path | Actual | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|--------|
| "Fix bug in login.py:42" | Clear & scoped → Execute | ✅ Correct | ✅ PASS |
| "Something's wrong with my app" | Ambiguous → State assumption | ⚠️ Should clarify first? | ⚠️ EDGE CASE |
| "Refactor entire codebase + add tests" | Complex → Ephor | ✅ Correct | ✅ PASS |
| "Maybe update the config?" | Needs clarification → Ask questions | ✅ Correct | ✅ PASS |
| "Clear but many steps" | ??? | ❌ Ambiguous | ❌ BUG |

❌ **CRITICAL BUG:**
**BUG-016**: Branches are not mutually exclusive
- "Clear but multi-step" matches BOTH "Clear & scoped" AND "Complex/Multi-step"
- No tiebreaker logic

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATION:**
28. Add tiebreaker: if multiple branches match, use priority order (Complex > Clarify > Ambiguous > Clear)

---

### Test 3.2: Error Handling Decision Tree
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Coverage Analysis:**

✅ **COVERED:**
- Known fix → Apply ✅
- Needs investigation → RESEARCHER ✅
- Architectural issue → THINKER ✅
- Environment issue → Debug steps ✅

❌ **MISSING BRANCHES:**
- User error (typo in command)
- Permission error (file access denied)
- Network/API error (rate limiting, timeout)
- Circular dependency detected
- Out of memory error

❌ **LOGIC ERROR:**
How does system determine if issue is "Architectural" vs "Needs Investigation"?
- These categories overlap significantly
- No decision criteria provided

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
29. Add error classification tree: syntax → permission → logic → architecture
30. Define "Architectural": affects >3 files OR changes API contracts OR impacts design patterns

---

### Test 3.3: Code Modification Decision Tree
**Status:** ✅ PASS (with minor enhancements)
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z

**Analysis:**

✅ **STRENGTHS:**
- "File exists? → Read first" enforces safety
- "Tests affected? → Update tests too" maintains quality
- "Breaking change? → Warn, suggest migration" protects users

⚠️ **MINOR MISSING:**
- No backup recommendation before destructive changes
- No "File locked by another process" handling
- Could add "Preview changes before applying"

💡 **OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:**
31. Add: "Destructive change? → Offer git stash or backup first"
32. Add: "Preview diff before applying? → Show unified diff"
