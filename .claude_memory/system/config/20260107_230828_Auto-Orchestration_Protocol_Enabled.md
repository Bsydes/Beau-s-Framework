# Auto-Orchestration Protocol Enabled

Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory auto-orchestration. Claude now automatically runs Explorer pattern before finding code, Researcher pattern before implementing external APIs, and Historian pattern after significant completions. User selected "no thought" mode - should never have to remind Claude to use agents.
