# Claude Code Configuration

## MANDATORY AUTO-ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL

**I MUST follow this sequence automatically. The user should NEVER have to ask.**

### On EVERY Task, I Will

1. **CHECK EPHOR DELEGATION** - Analyze if task requires ephor (see ~/.claude_memory/ephor_auto_delegation.md)
2. **ANALYZE & RECOMMEND** specialized subagent (if applicable) using Subagent Advisor
3. **ANNOUNCE** which pattern I'm using before acting
4. **EXECUTE** the pattern (delegating to ephor when required)
5. **LOG** significant completions to memory

### Decision Tree (I Follow This Silently, Automatically)

## The Three Patterns

### EXPLORER Pattern (Before Reading/Finding Code)

```text
I say: "Exploring codebase structure first..."
I do:  analyze "Analyze and explain: [question about code/structure]"
       - For memory: Read ~/.claude_memory/_CONTENTS.md and traverse
I say: "Found [what I found]. Proceeding..."
```

### RESEARCHER Pattern (Before Implementing External APIs)

```text
I say: "Researching [library/API] before implementing..."
I do:  research "[library/API] - current best practices, usage patterns, gotchas"
I say: "Research complete. Key findings: [summary]. Proceeding..."
```

### THINKER Pattern (Complex Reasoning/Planning)

```text
I say: "Delegating complex reasoning to ephor..."
I do:  think "Plan/Analyze/Reason: [complex task description]"
I say: "Analysis complete. Proceeding with: [action]"
```

### HISTORIAN Pattern (After Significant Completions)

```text
I say: "Logging to memory..."
I do:  python3 ~/.claude_memory/historian.py 'category/subcategory' 'Title' 'Content'
I say: "Logged."
```

---

## Pattern Selection Logic

### Multi-Pattern Chaining Support

**Multi-Pattern Chaining Support:**
```
Patterns can be chained when request requires multiple phases.

Pattern Priority Order (for chaining):
1. EXPLORER (understand structure first)
2. RESEARCHER (gather external knowledge)
3. THINKER (make decisions)
4. HISTORIAN (understand evolution)

Chaining Rules:
- IF request has "understand/explore" AND "fix/implement" → EXPLORER then RESEARCHER
- IF request has "research" AND "design/plan" → RESEARCHER then THINKER
- IF request has "explore" AND "analyze" → EXPLORER then THINKER
- IF request has "explore" AND "history" → EXPLORER then HISTORIAN
- IF request has 3+ pattern triggers → Chain in priority order

Single Pattern Selection:
- IF ONLY exploring_unknown_system → EXPLORER
- IF ONLY debugging_or_investigating → RESEARCHER
- IF ONLY design_decision_needed → THINKER
- IF ONLY understanding_evolution → HISTORIAN
- IF routine_task → No pattern (direct execution)

Pattern Trigger Keywords:
- EXPLORER: "explore", "understand structure", "map", "navigate", "where is"
- RESEARCHER: "research", "investigate", "debug", "why does", "how does"
- THINKER: "design", "plan", "analyze", "decide", "evaluate", "compare"
- HISTORIAN: "history", "evolution", "changed", "when was", "git log"
```

## What Counts as "Significant" for Historian

- Bug fixed
- Feature implemented
- Workflow created/modified
- Configuration changed
- Research findings worth preserving
- System setup completed

NOT significant: Reading files, asking questions, minor edits, failed attempts

---

## Ephor LLM Delegation (Token Saver)

**Purpose:** Route "thinking" tasks to unlimited Opus 4.5 via ephor, keep Claude Code for orchestration/execution.

| Command | Use For | Model |
| ------- | ------- | ----- |
| `/Users/bsydes/.local/bin/ephor "query"` | General reasoning, research, analysis | Opus 4.5 |
| `/Users/bsydes/.local/bin/ephor-agent "query"` | Document creation (xlsx/pptx/docx/pdf) | Opus 4.5 |

**Delegation Rules:**

- Delegate: Complex analysis, research, planning, reasoning
- Keep local: File reads/writes, bash commands, tool orchestration, final synthesis

---

## Active MCP Servers

- **n8n** - Workflow automation (connected to local instance)
- **memory** - Knowledge graph persistence

## Memory Locations

- `~/.claude_memory/` - Nested tree memory (use _CONTENTS.md for traversal)
- `~/.claude_memory/historian.py` - Logging script
- `~/.claude_memory/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` - Detailed agent rules
- `~/.claude_memory/subagent_advisor.md` - Auto-recommendation system for 140+ subagents
- `~/.claude_memory/ephor_auto_delegation.md` - **MANDATORY** auto-delegation rules & triggers

---

## Enforcement

If I skip a pattern I should have used, I am FAILING the user.

**CRITICAL:** If I skip an ephor delegation when triggers are met, I am WASTING the user's tokens and FAILING them.

The user chose "no thought" mode. They should not have to remind me.

**Token Conservation is MANDATORY:** The user has unlimited Opus 4.5 via ephor. I MUST use it for research/analysis/planning tasks.

---

## Task Intake Decision Tree

### 5.1 Task Intake (Priority-Ordered, Mutually Exclusive)

**Evaluation Order:** Check conditions top-to-bottom. First match wins.

```
USER REQUEST
    │
    ▼
1. Complex/Multi-step? ──────────→ Consider Ephor activation
   (3+ distinct deliverables OR
    Multi-domain work OR
    Mentions "all", "entire", "every" OR
    Requires >10 file changes)
    │
    ▼
2. Needs clarification? ─────────→ Ask 1-2 specific questions
   (Contains "maybe", "possibly", "?" OR
    Missing key details OR
    Multiple valid interpretations)
    │
    ▼
3. Ambiguous? ───────────────────→ State assumption, proceed
   (Vague description BUT
    Can infer reasonable approach OR
    Context provides clues)
    │
    ▼
4. Clear & scoped? ──────────────→ Execute directly
   (Specific file/line/function OR
    Single well-defined task OR
    <3 files, <5 steps)
    │
    ▼
5. Default: Treat as "Needs clarification"
```

**Priority Rationale:**
- Complexity checked first (most important routing decision)
- Clarification before assumptions (better to ask than guess)
- Ambiguous before clear (conservative - assumes unclear unless obvious)
- Default fallback prevents unhandled cases

```

### Historian Integration with Plugins

**Global memory** (system-wide learnings):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude_memory/historian.py 'category/subcategory' 'Title' 'Content'
```

**Project checkpoints** (plugin workflow states):
```python
from historian import save_checkpoint
save_checkpoint('Completed /write phase for auth module')
```

### Ephor + Plugins Strategy

**When to delegate to ephor (unlimited Opus 4.5):**
- Complex reasoning during `/brainstorm` → use `think "..."`
- External API research during `/write` → use `research "..."`
- Architecture decisions during planning → use `analyze "..."`
- Deep analysis for EXPLORER pattern → use `analyze "..."`

**Easy commands for ephor delegation:**
- `think "query"` - Deep reasoning and planning
- `research "query"` - Research external APIs, libraries, best practices
- `analyze "query"` - Architecture analysis, code structure analysis

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Build OAuth2 authentication"
  → /brainstorm (generates ideas)
  → research "OAuth2 best practices 2026" (deep research via ephor)
  → /write (create spec with research findings)
  → /execute (implement with TDD)
  → historian 'projects/my-app/auth' 'OAuth2 Complete' (log milestone)
```

### Plugin-First Rule

**Primary**: Use official plugins for their domains (`/brainstorm`, `/write`, `/execute`)
**Secondary**: Use original patterns when plugins don't fit (EXPLORER, RESEARCHER, THINKER)
**Tertiary**: Delegate heavy reasoning to ephor (unlimited Opus 4.5)
**Always**: Log significant completions to historian

**Rule**: If a plugin exists for the task, USE IT. Don't reinvent.

## Updated Enforcement

I MUST follow this enhanced protocol:

1. **CHECK EPHOR DELEGATION FIRST** (MANDATORY) - See ~/.claude_memory/ephor_auto_delegation.md
   - Match task against complexity triggers
   - Check token usage thresholds
   - Auto-delegate research/analysis/planning to ephor
   - Announce delegation with 🤖 emoji
2. **ANALYZE task using Subagent Advisor** - Recommend specialized subagent from 140+ options
3. Check if a plugin skill applies (`/brainstorm`, `/write`, `/execute`)
4. If not, use original patterns (EXPLORER, RESEARCHER, THINKER, HISTORIAN)
5. ALWAYS log significant completions

**CRITICAL FAILURES** (I am FAILING the user if I do this):
- Skip ephor delegation when triggers are met
- Use my tokens for research instead of ephor
- Skip pattern, plugin, or subagent recommendation
- Forget to announce which pattern I'm using
- Forget to log significant completions

**Non-Programmer Mode**: Always explain recommendations in plain English, show expected outcomes, and handle installations automatically.

**Token Conservation Rule**: "If I'm about to write >2 paragraphs of explanation/analysis/research, I MUST check if ephor should handle it instead."
