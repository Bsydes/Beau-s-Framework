# Checkpoint System Gap Analysis and Solution

FINDING: The requested Week 1/3/5/7 checkpoint and coaching structure was NOT programmed into the existing workshop design.

WHAT EXISTED:
- Week 1 (Day 1): Baseline capture via Mission 0
- Week 4 (Day 8): Logbook Audit (mid-workshop)
- Week 7 (Day 14): T2P Final Assessment

WHAT WAS MISSING:
1. Formal Checkpoint 1 at Week 3 with coaching intervention protocol
2. Formal Checkpoint 2 at Week 5 with coaching intervention protocol  
3. Post-T2P Coaching Feedback template
4. Unified Student Progress Tracker

FILES CREATED:
1. Student_Checkpoint_Tracker.md - Master tracking template with all 4 checkpoints
2. Checkpoint_Guide_L1.md - L1-specific guide with on-track/behind indicators
3. Checkpoint_Guide_L2.md - L2-specific guide emphasizing revision requirement
4. Checkpoint_Guide_L3.md - L3-specific guide with FAA tracking integration

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Checkpoint 1 moved to Day 6 (end of Week 3)
- Checkpoint 2 aligned with Day 10 (Week 5)
- Added coaching intervention questions for each checkpoint
- Created level-specific "red flags" for early intervention
- FAA study hour tracking integrated into L3 checkpoints
