# Comprehensive Framework Test - Iteration 1

Completed comprehensive test of Beaus Framework using Ralph Loop + Ephor delegation. Results: 15 bugs identified (5 critical: pattern chaining, keyword detection, tree logic), 3 redundancies (Ephor/Task-Master overlap), 35 optimization recommendations. Framework is 75% functional but NOT production-ready. Full report: /Users/bsydes/beaus_framework_test_report.md. Critical fixes needed before claiming 100% functionality.
