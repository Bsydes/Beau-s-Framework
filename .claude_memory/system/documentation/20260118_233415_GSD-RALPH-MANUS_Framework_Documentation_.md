# GSD-RALPH-MANUS Framework Documentation Complete

Documented the three core frameworks in QUICK-REFERENCE.md:

**GSD (Get Stuff Done)** - The Brain 🧠
- Auto-orchestration protocol via ~/CLAUDE.md
- Four patterns: EXPLORER, RESEARCHER, THINKER, HISTORIAN
- Routes tasks intelligently and delegates to ephor for research/analysis
- Status: ✅ Fully implemented and active

**RALPH** - The Stamina ⚡
- Autonomous execution loop (max 15 iterations)
- Command: /ralph-loop "task" --max-iterations 15
- Iterates until completion promise is met
- Status: ✅ Fully implemented via plugin

**MANUS** - The Protocols 📋
- File-based planning (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
- Command: /planning-with-files
- Context engineering based on Manus principles (acquired by Meta for $2B)
- Status: ✅ Fully implemented via plugin

All three frameworks work together:
1. GSD analyzes and routes tasks
2. MANUS provides persistent planning for complex tasks
3. RALPH handles autonomous iteration
4. GSD HISTORIAN logs completions to memory

Verified all installations and updated cheat sheet with complete reference.
