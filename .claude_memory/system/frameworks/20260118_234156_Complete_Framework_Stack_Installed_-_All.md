# Complete Framework Stack Installed - All Four Systems

Successfully installed and integrated all four major systems:

**1. Original GSD Framework (v1.6.4)**
- Installed via: npx get-shit-done-cc@latest
- Location: ~/.claude/commands/gsd/ and ~/.claude/get-shit-done/
- Commands: 24 total commands for full project lifecycle
- Key features:
  * /gsd:new-project - Interactive project initialization
  * /gsd:discuss-phase - Capture user preferences before implementation
  * /gsd:plan-phase - Research + atomic task planning
  * /gsd:execute-phase - Parallel execution with fresh contexts
  * /gsd:verify-work - Guided UAT + auto-fix generation
  * /gsd:map-codebase - Analyze existing code patterns
  * /gsd:complete-milestone - Archive + tag releases

**2. Custom Auto-Orchestration (Already Had)**
- Location: ~/CLAUDE.md
- Patterns: EXPLORER, RESEARCHER, THINKER, HISTORIAN
- Ephor delegation for research/analysis (unlimited Opus 4.5)
- Automatic routing based on task type

**3. MANUS - planning-with-files (Already Had)**
- Plugin-based file planning system
- Creates: task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md
- Context engineering based on Manus principles
- Command: /planning-with-files

**4. RALPH (Already Had)**
- Autonomous execution loop (max 15 iterations)
- Never gives up until completion promise met
- Command: /ralph-loop "task"

**How They Work Together:**
- Original GSD handles project lifecycle (initialization → milestones)
- Custom orchestration provides intelligent routing within phases
- MANUS handles task-level planning for complex individual tasks
- RALPH provides autonomous iteration when needed
- Ephor provides unlimited Opus 4.5 for research/analysis

**Documentation Created:**
- ~/.claude/GSD-COMPARISON.md - Feature-by-feature comparison
- ~/.claude/COMPLETE-FRAMEWORK.md - Complete workflow guide
- ~/.claude/QUICK-REFERENCE.md - Updated with all commands

**This is now the most complete Claude Code setup possible!**

User can choose workflow based on project size:
1. Quick tasks: Custom orchestration only
2. Complex features: MANUS + RALPH + custom orchestration
3. Full projects: Complete GSD workflow + all other systems

Installation completed successfully. All 24 GSD commands verified and available.
